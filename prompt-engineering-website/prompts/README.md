# Prompt Engineering Guide

This directory contains detailed, reusable prompts for generating website sections using AI coding tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).

## Overview

Each prompt is designed to be:
- **Long and detailed**: Comprehensive instructions for consistent output
- **Reusable**: Works consistently across different AI tools
- **Structured**: Clear sections and requirements
- **Production-ready**: Generates clean, responsive, accessible code

## Prompts Included

1. **navigation-prompt.md** - Responsive navigation bar with mobile menu
2. **hero-prompt.md** - Compelling hero section with CTA
3. **services-prompt.md** - Services/features showcase section
4. **contact-form-prompt.md** - Contact form with validation
5. **footer-prompt.md** - Comprehensive footer with links and info

## How to Use These Prompts

1. Open any prompt file
2. Copy the entire prompt content
3. Paste it into your preferred AI coding tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
4. The AI will generate complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code
5. Customize the generated code as needed (colors, content, etc.)

## Prompt Structure

Each prompt follows this structure:
- **Context**: Sets the role and expertise level
- **Requirements**: Detailed specifications for HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Design Specifications**: Visual and UX guidelines
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach details
- **Code Quality**: Standards and best practices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance requirements
- **Output Format**: Expected code structure
- **Customization Points**: Easy modification areas

## Best Practices

- Use prompts as-is for consistent results
- Customize content (text, colors) after generation
- Test generated code across devices
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Optimize images and assets

## Notes

- Prompts are tool-agnostic (work with any AI coding assistant)
- Generated code follows modern web standards
- All prompts emphasize responsive design
- Accessibility is built into each prompt
